# CPM_MODULES
CPM_MODULE is a repository containing modules that might help you on your c projects

### BUILD SYSTEMS
you can use any build system with this project, however this project was already pre-configured to use a custom wannabe build system called **C-Project-Manager (CPM)** And **it's eaiser to git clone the modules individually with the CPM CLI.**

#### IF USING MAKE OR CMAKE 
all of the modules are split to make it eaiser, **I've split it in 3 folders: srcs, include, and sometimes there is a lib folder**. All external dependencies are in the lib folder.
